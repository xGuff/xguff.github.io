Article studying the use of cliches in Premier League manager pre-match press conferences for the 2024/2025 season.

Of the 20 clubs competing in the 2024/2025 Premier League season, 13 have a dedicated Youtube playlist, to which their press conferences are uploaded. This is important, because it means that... 

Where available, transcripts were retreived from the playlists using the [youtube-transcript-api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/). [Approximate string matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) (also referred to as fuzzy matching) was performed on the transcripts to identify instances of cliche usage from a [predefined list of football cliches](https://github.com/xGuff/xCliches/blob/main/data/cliches.yaml). 

Figure 1 illustrates a word cloud in which the size and colour of the cliches are proportional to the number of times they have been mentioned in Premier League press conferences this season.

When comparing the use of cliches between clubs, there is a key issue that has to be considered. Not all press conferences are of equal length, and not all clubs have the same number of press conferences uploaded. This means that comparing each club based on the number of cliches used is not a fair comparison. If you're a fan of football stats, you will have long been aware of stats like "goals per 90 minutes" and "expected goals per 90 minutes". These stats are used to normalise the number of goals scored by a player or team, taking into account the amount of time they have spent on the pitch. This is important because it allows for a fair comparison between players and teams, regardless of the amount of time they have spent on the pitch.

I have employed something similar here. The average speaking rate for a person is around 150 words per minute. If this holds true for the speach in Premier League press conferences (which I have not checked, and will not check because I am too lazy), then 

 I have assumed a speaking rate of 130 words per minute. This means that for every 10,000 words spoken in a press conference, it would take approximately 77 minutes to deliver. Therefore, to compare the use of cliches between clubs, I have normalised the number of cliches used by dividing the total number of cliches used by the number of words in each press conference and multiplying by 10,000. This gives us a figure that represents the number of cliches used per 10,000 words spoken in a press conference.

the number of cliches used was normalised by the number of words in each press conference. This allows for a more accurate comparison between clubs, as it takes into account the length of each press conference.
